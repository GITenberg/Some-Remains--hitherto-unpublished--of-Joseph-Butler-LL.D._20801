3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>It has long been a subject of regret that we should have so 
few remains of so great a writer as the author of the 
&ldquo;Analogy,&rdquo; not only the greatest thinker of his day, 
but one almost equally remarkable for his personal religion and 
amiability.</p>
<p>The few fragments and letters which remain unpublished, derive
from this circumstance a value wholly incommensurate with their 
extent, though, as to the few I have been able to recover, they 
seem to me worthy of notice even for their own sake.</p>
<p>There can, I suppose, be no doubt but that many letters on 
subjects connected with their common pursuit,&mdash;the defence 
of religion by rational arguments,&mdash;must have passed between
Dr. Clarke and the &ldquo;Gentleman in Gloucestershire,&rdquo; 
even up to the time of the former&rsquo;s decease; and the 
specimen I am now able to exhibit certainly excites a wish that 
one could recover more of a series which it is most likely that 
Dr. Clarke at least carefully preserved.&nbsp; The three letters 
now printed were all addressed to <!-- page 4--><a 
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Dr. Clarke; the
first and last, though little known, were published many years 
ago in the European Magazine.</p>
<p>The second and third Fragments are printed as they were 
written, having apparently been noted down from time to time as 
the ideas occurred to their author; thus at the end of the first 
paragraph of the third Fragment, the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo;
was originally written &ldquo;advice,&rdquo; but was subsequently
altered in a different ink, being the same with that in which the
sentences immediately following were written.&nbsp; I have not 
thought myself at liberty to make any attempt to reduce these 
Fragments to better consistency; indeed, their present disordered
state seems to me rather to add to their interest, as showing the
mode in which the stones were gathered for building up such works
as the &ldquo;Analogy&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Sermons.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It will be observed that I have found a difficulty in reading the
last part of the third Fragment, and I am by no means sure that I
have quite hit the sense intended; I should like it to apply 
either to the Cross set up at Bristol, or to the famous Charge 
delivered at Durham.</p>
<p>I have added a cotemporary notice of the buildings at Bristol,
and an anecdote showing how they were thought of, as well as a 
statement, made after the Bishop&rsquo;s death, of his 
proceedings with regard to the church, which is now St. 
George&rsquo;s, near Bristol, in order to establish the fact of 
the separation of the property there mentioned from the bulk of 
his <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
5</span>estate;&mdash;showing his desire to do something for the 
benefit of the people of Kingswood, a district the moral 
degradation of which had already attracted the attention of 
Whitefield and Wesley.</p>
<p>The following extract has been kindly communicated to me from 
the Diary of Dr. Thomas Wilson, the son of the great Bishop of 
Sodor and Man; and I print it here more especially to invite the 
attention of all who take an interest in these things to the 
fact, that a copy may have been made for the King of the sermon 
there mentioned, and may possibly even yet be in existence 
somewhere; if so, it cannot but be worth the trouble of recovery 
and publication.</p>
<blockquote><p>1737, December, Friday, 23rd.&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
Master [<i>i.e.</i> Sir Joseph Jekyll, Master of the Rolls] told 
me that the King desired that Dr. Butler, Clerk of the Closet to 
the late Queen, might preach before him in the Princess 
Amelia&rsquo;s apartments.&nbsp; He preached upon the subject of 
being bettered by afflictions, which affected His Majesty so much
that he desired the sermon, and assured him that he would do 
something very good for him.&nbsp; The Master desired that it 
might be known publicly, it was told him by the Bishop of Oxford 
[Seeker].&nbsp; The Master seemed mightily pleased, and was in 
hopes it would be of great service to the public as well as his 
private family, which will be a pleasure to every body, and make 
even the death of Her Majesty (so great a seeming loss) of 
advantage to the nation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

the pleasure with which some copies I had given away privately 
have been received, and I confess that the fruit I should be most
gratified to see, would be the recovery of some longer work, not 
less worthy of its Author&rsquo;s reputation.</p>

7</span>FRAGMENTS.</h2>
<p>From the autographs of Bp. Butler now in the library at the 
British Museum.&nbsp; [Add. MS. 9815.]</p>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>God cannot approve of any thing but what is in itself Right, 
Fit, Just.&nbsp; We should worship and endeavour to obey Him with
this Consciousness and Recollection.&nbsp; To endeavour to please
a man merely, is a different thing from endeavouring to please 
him as a wise and good man, <i>i.e.</i> endeavouring to please 
him in the particular way, of behaving towards him as we think 
the relations we stand in to him, and the intercourse we have 
with him, require.</p>
<p>Almighty God is to be sure infinitely removed from all those 
human weaknesses which we express by the words, captious, apt to 
take offence, &amp;c.&nbsp; But an unthinking world does not 
consider what may be absolutely due to Him from all Creatures 
capable of considering themselves as His Creatures.&nbsp; 
Recollect the idea, inadequate as it is, which we have of God, 
and the idea of ourselves, and carelessness with regard to Him, 
whether we are to <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>worship Him at all, whether we worship
Him in a right manner, or conceited confidence that we do so, 
will seem to imply unspeakable Presumption.&nbsp; Neither do we 
know what necessary, unalterable connexion there may be, between 
moral right and happiness, moral wrong and misery.</p>
<p>Sincerity is doubtless the thing, and not whether we hit the 
right manner, &amp;c.&nbsp; But a sense of the imperfection of 
our worship, apprehension that it may be, and a degree of fear 
that it is, in some respects erroneous, may perhaps be a temper 
of mind not unbecoming such poor creatures as we are, in our 
addresses to God.&nbsp; In proportion as we are assured that we 
are honest and sincere, we may rest satisfied that God cannot be 
offended with us, but indifference whether what we do be 
materially, or in the nature of the thing abstracted from our way
of considering it, Good and Right,&mdash;such indifference is 
utterly inconsistent with Sincerity.</p>
<p>No person who has just notions of God can be afraid of His 
displeasure any further than as he is afraid of his own 
Character, whether it be what it ought: but so far as a man has 
reason to fear his own character, so far there must be reason to 
fear God&rsquo;s displeasure, or disapprobation; not from any 
doubt of His Perfection and Goodness, but merely from the belief 
of it.</p>
<p>Is it possible that people can be Scepticks in <i>Opinion</i>,
and yet without any doubtfulness, or solicitude about their 
<i>Actions</i> and <i>Behaviour</i>?</p>
<h3><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>II.</h3>
<p>What a wonderful incongruity it is for a man to see the 
doubtfulness in which things are involved, and yet be impatient 
out of action, or vehement in it!&nbsp; Say a man is a Sceptick, 
and add what was said of Brutus, <i>quicquid vult valde vult</i>,
and you say, there is the greatest Contrariety between his 
Understanding and his Temper that can be expressed in words.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In general a man ought not to do other people&rsquo;s duty for
them; for their duty was appointed them for their exercise; and 
besides, who will do it in case of his death?&nbsp; Nor has a man
any right to raise in others such a dependance upon him as that 
they must be miserable in case of his death, tho&rsquo; whilst he
lives he answers that dependance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Hobbs&rsquo; definition of Benevolence, that &rsquo;tis the 
love of power is base and false, but there is more of truth in it
than appears at first sight; the real Benevolence of men being, I
think, for the most part, not indeed the single love of power, 
but the love of power to be exercised in the way of doing good; 
that is a different thing from the love of the good or happiness 
of others by whomsoever effected, which last I call single or 
simple Benevolence.&nbsp; How little there is of this in the 
world may appear by observing, how many persons can bear with 
great tranquillity that <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>a friend or child should live in 
misery, who yet cannot bear the thought of their death.</p>
<p>Good men surely are not treated in this world as they deserve,
yet &rsquo;tis seldom, very seldom their goodness which makes 
them disliked, even in cases where it may seem to be so: but 
&rsquo;tis some behaviour or other, which however excusable, 
perhaps infinitely overbalanced by their virtues, yet is 
offensive, possibly wrong; however such, it may be, as would pass
off very well in a man of the world.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>Shall I not be faithful to God?&nbsp; If He puts a part upon 
me to do, shall I neglect or refuse it?&nbsp; A part to suffer, 
and shall I say I would not if I could help it?&nbsp; Can words 
more ill-sorted, more shocking be put together?&nbsp; And is not 
the thing expressed by them more so, tho&rsquo; not expressed in 
words?&nbsp; What then shall I prefer to the sovereign Good, 
supreme Excellence, absolute Perfection?&nbsp; To whom shall I 
apply for direction in opposition to Infinite Wisdom?&nbsp; To 
whom for protection against Almighty Power?</p>

oculi servorum <i>intenti sunt</i> ad manum dominorum suorum, 
sicut oculi ancillae ad manum dominae suae; ita oculi nostri ad

<p>As all my passions and affections to my Reason such as it is, 
so in consideration of the fallibility and infinite deficiencies 
of this my Reason, I would subject it to God, that He may guide 
and succour it.</p>
<p>Our wants as Creatures: our Demerits as Sinners.</p>

it, or wholly discharge me of it.</p>
<p>Be more afraid of myself than of the world.</p>
<p>To discern the hand of God in every thing and have a due sense
of it.</p>

well in times and circumstances other than those in which one is 
placed, to take care and be faithful and behave well in those one
is placed in.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>
<p>From a Copy formerly belonging to Dr. Birch, and now in the 
library at the British Museum.&nbsp; [Add. MS. 4370.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Dr.</span></p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas but last night I received your letter from 
Gloucester, having left that place three weeks since.&nbsp; It 
revived in my mind some very melancholy thoughts I had upon my 
being obliged to quit those studies, that had a direct tendency 
to divinity, that being what I should chuse for the business of 
my life, it being, I think, of all other studies the most 
suitable to a reasonable nature.&nbsp; I say my being obliged, 
for there is every encouragement (whether one regards interest or
usefulness) now-a-days for any to enter that profession, who has 
not got a way of commanding his assent to received opinions 
without examination.</p>
<p>I had some thoughts, Sir, of paying you my acknowledgments in 
person for that surprising air of candour and affability with 
which you have treated me in the Letters that have passed between
us.&nbsp; But really I could not put on so bold a face, as to 
intrude into a gentleman&rsquo;s company with no other excuse but
that of having received an obligation from him.&nbsp; I have not 
the least prospect of ever being in <!-- page 13--><a 
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>a capacity of
giving any more than a verbal declaration of my gratitude: so I 
hope you&rsquo;l accept that, and believe it&rsquo;s with the 
utmost sincerity I subscribe myself,</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Your most obliged, most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">J. BUTLER.</p>
<p>Hamlin&rsquo;s Coffee-house,<br />
Tuesday Morning.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>The original of this Letter with the answer, which is roughly 
written on the blank leaf, is, I believe, now in the library of 
Oriel College, Oxford.&nbsp; I am indebted for my copy to the 
kindness of the Rev. J. H. Newman, D.D., formerly of that 
College.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I had long resisted an Inclination to desire your Thoughts 
upon the difficulty mentioned in my last, till I considered that 
the trouble in answering it would be only carrying on the general
purpose of your Life, and that I might claim the same right to 
your Instructions with others; notwithstanding which, I should 
not have mentioned it to you had I not thought (which is natural 
when one fancies one sees a thing clearly) that I could easily 
express it with clearness to others.&nbsp; However I should by no
means have given you a second trouble upon the subject had I not 
had your particular leave.&nbsp; I thought proper just to mention
these things that you might <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>not suspect 
me to take advantage from your Civility to trouble you with any 
thing, but only such objections as seem to me of Weight, and 
which I cannot get rid of any other way.&nbsp; A disposition in 
our natures to be influenced by right motives is as absolutely 
necessary to render us moral Agents, as a Capacity to discern 
right motives is.&nbsp; These two are I think quite 
<i>distinct</i> perceptions, the <i>former</i> proceeding from a 
desire inseparable from a Conscious Being of its own happiness, 
the <i>latter</i> being only our Understanding, or Faculty of 
seeing Truth.&nbsp; Since a <i>disposition</i> to be influenced 
by right motives is a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> to Virtuous 
Actions, an Indifferency to right motives must 
<i>incapacitate</i> us for Virtuous Actions, or render us in that
particular not moral agents.&nbsp; I do indeed think that no 
Rational Creature is <i>strictly speaking Indifferent</i> to 
Right Motives, but yet there seems to be somewhat which to all 
intents of the present question is the same, viz. <i>a stronger 
disposition to be influenced by contrary or wrong motives</i>, 
and this I take to be always the Case when any vice is 
committed.&nbsp; But since it may be said, as you hint, that this
stronger disposition to be influenced by Vicious Motives may have
been contracted by repeated Acts of Wickedness, we will pitch 
upon the <i>first Vicious Action</i> any one is guilty of.&nbsp; 
No man would have committed this first Vicious Action if he had 
not had a <i>stronger</i> (at least as strong) <i>disposition</i>
in him to be influenced by the <i>Motives of the Vicious 
Action</i>, than by the <i>motives </i><!-- page 15--><a 
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span><i>of the 
contrary Virtuous Action</i>; from whence I infallibly conclude, 
that since every man has committed some first Vice, every man 
had, <i>antecedent</i> to the commission of it, a <i>stronger 
disposition</i> to be influenced by the <i>Vicious</i> than the 
<i>Virtuous</i> motive.&nbsp; My difficulty upon this is, that a 
<i>stronger natural disposition</i> to be influenced by the 
Vicious than the Virtuous Motive (which every one has antecedent 
to his first vice), seems, to all purposes of the present 
question, to put the Man in the same condition as though he was 
<i>indifferent to the Virtuous Motive</i>; and since an 
<i>indifferency to the Virtuous Motive</i> would have 
<i>incapacitated</i> a Man from being a <i>moral Agent</i>, or 
<i>contracting guilt</i>, is not a <i>stronger disposition</i> to
be influenced by the <i>Vicious</i> Motive as great an 
<i>Incapacity</i>?&nbsp; Suppose I have two diversions offered 
me, <i>both</i> of which I could not enjoy, I like both of them, 
but yet have a <i>stronger</i> inclination to one than to the 
other, I am not indeed strictly <i>indifferent</i> to either, 
because I should be glad to <i>enjoy both</i>; but am I not 
exactly <i>in the same case</i>, <i>to all intents and purposes 
of acting</i>, as though I was <i>absolutely indifferent</i> to 
that diversion which I have the <i>least</i> inclination 
to?&nbsp; You suppose Man to be endued naturally with a 
<i>disposition to be influenced by Virtuous Motives</i>, and that
<i>this Disposition is a sine qu&acirc; non to Virtuous 
Actions</i>, both which I fully believe; but then you <i>omit</i>
to consider the natural Inclination to be influenced by Vicious 
Motives, which, <i>whenever a Vice is committed</i>, is at least 
<i>equally strong</i> with the <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>other, and in
the first Vice <i>is not affected by Habits</i>, but is as 
<i>natural</i>, and as much <i>out of a man&rsquo;s power</i> as 
the other.&nbsp; I am much obliged to your offer of writing to 
Mr. Laughton, which I shall very thankfully accept of, but am not
certain when I shall go to Cambridge; however, I believe it will 
be about the middle of the next month.</p>
<p>I am, Rev. Sir,<br />
Your most obliged humble Servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">J. BUTLER.</p>
<p>Oriel, Oct. the 6th.</p>
<h4>THE ANSWER.</h4>
<p>Your objection seems indeed very dexterous, and yet I really 
think that there is at bottom nothing in it.&nbsp; But of this 
you are to judge, not from my assertion, but from the reason I 
shall endeavour to give to it.</p>
<p>I think then, that a <i>disposition to be influenced by right 
motives</i> being what we call <i>rationality</i>, there cannot 
be on the contrary (properly speaking) any such thing naturally 
in rational creatures as a <i>disposition to be influenced by 
wrong motives</i>.&nbsp; This can be nothing but mere 
<i>perverseness of will</i>; and whether even that can be said to
amount to a disposition to be influenced by wrong motives, 
<i>formally</i>, and as such, may (I think) well be 
doubted.&nbsp; Men have by nature strong inclinations to certain 
objects.&nbsp; None of these inclinations are vicious, but vice 
consists in pursuing the inclination towards any object in 
certain <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>circumstances, notwithstanding 
<i>reason</i>, or the natural disposition to be influenced by 
right motives, declares to the man&rsquo;s conscience at the same
time (or would do, if he attended to it) that the object ought 
not to be pursued in those circumstances.&nbsp; Nevertheless, 
where the man commits the crime, the <i>natural disposition</i> 
was only towards the <i>object</i>, not formally towards the 
doing it upon wrong motives; and generally the very essence of 
the crime consists in the liberty of the will forcibly overruling
the <i>actual disposition towards being influenced by right 
motives</i>, and not at all (as you suppose) in the man&rsquo;s 
having any <i>natural disposition to be influenced by wrong 
motives</i>, as such.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I had the honour of your kind letter yesterday, and must own 
that I do now see a <i>difference</i> between the nature of 
<i>that disposition which we have to be influenced by virtuous 
motives</i>, and <i>that contrary disposition</i>, (or whatever 
else it may <i>properly</i> be called,) which is the 
<i>occasion</i> of our committing <i>sin</i>; and hope in time to
get a thorough insight into this Subject by means of those helps 
you have been pleased to afford me.&nbsp; I find it necessary to 
consider such very abstruse questions <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>at different 
times and in different dispositions; and have found particular 
use of this method upon that abstract subject of 
<i>Necessity</i>: for tho&rsquo; I did not see the force of your 
argument for the <i>unity of the Divine Nature</i> when I had 
done writing to you upon that subject, I am now <i>fully 
satisfied</i> that it is conclusive.&nbsp; I will only just add 
that I suppose somewhat in my last letter was not clearly 
expressed, for I did not at all <i>design</i> to say, that <i>the
essence of any crime consisted in the man&rsquo;s having a 
natural disposition to be influenced by wrong motives</i>.</p>
<p>I was fully resolved to have gone to Cambridge some time in 
this Term, not in the least expecting but that I might have the 
Terms allowed there which I have kept here, but I am informed by 
one who has been there that it is not at all to be depended upon;
but that it&rsquo;s more likely to be refused than granted 
me.&nbsp; My design was this; when I had taken the Degree of 
Batchelor of Arts at Cambridge, (which I would have done to have 
the Priviledge of that Gown,) to take that of Batchelor of Law a 
year afterwards, but if I cannot have the Terms I have kept for 
Batchelor of Arts allowed there, it will be highly proper for me 
to stay at Oxford to take that degree here, before I go to 
Cambridge to take Batchelor of Law.&nbsp; I will inquire 
concerning the truth of what the gentleman told me, and if I find
he is mistaken and that I can take the degree of Batchelor of 
Arts at Cambridge <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>next June, which is the time I shall 
be standing for it, and Batchelor of Law a year after that; I 
will make bold to accept of your kind offer to write to Mr. 
Laughton, and will acquaint you with it as soon as I am 
satisfied, otherwise I will give you no further trouble in the 
matter; and indeed I am sorry I should have given you any already
upon it, but I thought I had sufficient reason to be satisfied, 
and had not the least suspicion in the world that there was any 
uncertainty about getting the Terms allowed, so I hope you will 
excuse it.</p>
<p>I am with the greatest respect and gratitude for all your 
favours,</p>
<p>Rev. Sir,<br />
Your most obedient humble Servant,</p>

<p>I should have written yesterday, to prevent your trouble of 
writing to Mr. Laughton, but I was not informed of what I have 
mentioned before last night.</p>

<p>This Letter, as well as the one immediately preceding, appears

<p>O Almighty God, Maker and Preserver of the world, Governor and
Judge of all creatures, whom Thou hast endued with understanding 
so as to render them accountable for their actions and capable of
being judged for them; we prostrate ourselves as in Thy presence,
and worship Thee the Sovereign Lord of all, in Whom we live and 
move and have our being.&nbsp; The greatness and perfection of 
Thy Nature is infinitely beyond all possible comprehension, but 
in proportion to our capacities we would endeavour to have a true
conception of Thy Divine Majesty, and to live under a just sense 
and apprehension of it: that we may fear Thee and hope in Thee as
we entirely depend upon Thee: that we may love Thee as supremely 
good, and have our wills conformed to Thy will in all 
righteousness and truth: that we may be thankful to Thee for 
every thing we enjoy, as the gift of Thine hand, and be patient 
under every affliction as what Thou sendest or permittest.</p>
<p>We desire to be duly sensible of what we have done amiss, and 
we solemnly resolve before Thee, that for the time to come we 
will endeavour to obey all Thy commands as they are made known to
us.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>We are Thy Creatures by Nature; we give up ourselves to 
be Thy servants voluntarily and by Choice, and present ourselves,
body and soul, a living sacrifice to Thee.</p>
<p>But, O Almighty God, as Thou hast manifested Thyself to the 
world by Jesus Christ; as Thou hast given Him to be a 
Propitiation for the sins of it, and the Mediator between God and
Man; we lay hold with all humility and thankfulness on so 
inestimable a Benefit, and come unto Thee according to Thine 
appointment in His Name, and in the form and manner which He has 
taught us.</p>
<p>Our Father, &amp;c.</p>
<h3>MORNING PRAYER.</h3>
<p>Almighty God, by whose protection we were preserved the night 
passed, and are here before Thee this morning in health and 
safety; we dedicate this day, and all the days we have to live to
Thy service; resolving, that we will abstain from all evil, that 
we will take heed to the thing that is right in all our actions, 
and endeavour to do our duty in that state of life in which Thy 
Providence has placed us.&nbsp; We would remind ourselves that we
are always, wherever we may go, in Thy presence.&nbsp; We would 
be always in Thy fear; and we beg the continuance of Thy merciful
protection, and that Thou would&rsquo;st guide and keep us in all
our ways through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Almighty God, whose continued providence ordereth all things 
both in Heaven and Earth; Who never slumberest nor sleepest; but 
hast divided the light from the darkness, and made the day for 
employment and the night for rest to Thy creatures the 
inhabitants of the earth: we acknowledge with all thankfulness 
Thy merciful preservation of us this day, by which we are brought
in safety to the evening of it.&nbsp; We implore Thy forgiveness 
of all the offences which we have been guilty of in it, whether 
in thought, word, or deed; and desire to have a due sense of Thy 
goodness in keeping us out of the way of those temptations by 
which we might have fallen into greater sins, and in preserving 
us from those misfortunes and sad accidents, common to every day,
and which must have befallen many others.&nbsp; We humbly commit 
ourselves to the same good providence this night, that we may 
sleep in quiet under Thy protection, and wake, if it be Thy will,
in the morning in renewed life and strength.&nbsp; And we beg the
assistance of Thy grace to live in such a manner, that when the 
few days and nights which thou shalt allot us in this world be 
passed away, we may die in peace, and finally obtain the 
resurrection unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

field, and hast given unto us all things that pertain unto life

moderation and temperance in the use of them, by being kind and 
compassionate to those who are in distress, and by all those good
works which Thou hast appointed us to walk in.&nbsp; And we

<p><i>From the MS. Collections of the Rev. W. Cole</i>, <i>now in
the Library at the British Museum</i>.&nbsp; <i>Vol.</i> 10, 
<i>p.</i> 92, <i>taken at Bristol in the year</i> 1746.</p>
<p>Having done with what is in the Cathedral, let us just step 
into the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace on the south side of it: and here 
we cannot help observing the generous Temper of the present 
worthy prelate; who in a poor Bishoprick of about &pound;500 per 
ann. has already laid out on building an entire new Palace in the
room of the old one which was gone to decay, above 
&pound;3000.&nbsp; The small Chapel belonging to the old one is 
standing; but entirely new fitted up, furnished in an elegant 
Taste and newly wainscoted and a Tribune from one of his 
Lordship&rsquo;s rooms to look into it at the west end, over the 
door which is entirely new.&nbsp; The altar piece is of black 
marble inlaid with a milk white cross of white marble; which is 
plain and has a good effect.&nbsp; In the East window over it is 
a small Crucifix with the B. Virgin and St. John under the Cross 
weeping, of old glass; and not very curious.&nbsp; Over the new 
Door into the Chapel from the Hall, in a void space made on 
purpose, is a very old Coat of Glass of the Arms of Berkly 
ensigned with a mitre: and this is another reason to make one 
think that the old Abbey of Bristol gave these arms to their 
Founder, for their own Coat.&nbsp; I was pleased to find the 
present Bishop paid such a regard to the memory of <!-- page 
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the 
Ancient Abbey and its Founders, as to preserve this old memorial 
of them with so much care and precaution.&nbsp; A pattern worthy 
to be imitated in an age, that to my knowledge, in certain 
places, has not only had such marks of their benefactors taken 
away in order to get up modern crown glass; but has also given 
away and destroyed such memorials of them, as the care of their 
predecessors for 3 or 400 years have with the utmost gratitude 
and veneration preserved.</p>
<p>Over the hall chimney-piece, which is preserved with equal 
care by his Lordship, are the arms of Bishop Wright impaled by 
his See, and a mitre over them, and R. W. on each side of them; 
as also Wright impaling per Pale und&eacute; six martlets 
countercharged for Fleetwood.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see his Lordship&rsquo;s Arms in any part of the
Palace, which has so just a title to have them in every part of 
it; but however, I shall give them a place here in gratitude to 
his memory who so well deserves of this place, which, though I 
have no concern in, nor no acquaintance with his Lordship, yet 
one always has a value for a grateful and benevolent mind.</p>
<p>The arms of Joseph Butler, Lord Bishop of Bristol and Dean of 
St. Paul&rsquo;s, are: A. three covered Cups on Bend S, inter two
Bendlets engrailed G.</p>
<p>His Lordship was, on the decease of the late Lord Bishop of 
Hereford, by his Majesty appointed Clerk of the Royal Closet; and
it is said that he has also <!-- page 26--><a 
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>a promise, on
the next vacancy, of a translation to the rich See of Durham, 
which will be well bestowed on a person of his Lordship&rsquo;s 
large and universal benevolence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>From the same.</p>
<p>Dr. Freeman, speaking of the chapel in the palace at Bristol, 
told me that he was mentioning the neatness and elegance of it to
Bishop Young at Therfield, who told him, that however he might 
admire the decency and elegance of it, yet upon his waiting, upon
some occasion or other, on my Lord Hardwick, his Lordship spoke 
to him of it, and asked him whether he had not a design of 
pulling down the cross of marble over the Altar, which he thought
was offensive; to which the Bishop replied, that it was probable 
that he should not have set it up there, but that he should not 
choose to have it said that Bishop Young had pulled down what 
Bishop Butler had erected.</p>

27</span>STATEMENT CONCERNING THE CHURCH AT KINGSWOOD.</h3>
<p>From a MS. in the British Museum.&nbsp; [Add. 9815.]</p>
<p>When the late Lord Bishop of Durham first intended to have a 
place of Divine Worship erected in Kings Wood, his Scheme 
was,&mdash;To solicit Subscriptions for building a Chapel, and to
give &pound;400 towards the Endowment of it, in order to get the 
like Sum from the Governors of Q. Ann&rsquo;s Bounty.&nbsp; And 
he was pleased to lay his Commands upon me to make Application to
persons the most likely to contribute to that good Work.</p>
<p>The report I brought him in Consequence of such Application, 
was to this Effect, that they highly approved of the pious and 
charitable design, but disliked the particular Scheme of erecting
a Chapel of Ease to the Church of St. Philip and Jacob, as this 
would not answer the good purposes his Lordship intended; and 
therefore proposed a Division of the Parish, and the Erection of 
a new Parish and parish Church.</p>
<p>His observations on this Proposal were the 
following,&mdash;That the intended Chapel in Kings Wood would not
have been a Chapel of Ease to Saint Philip and Jacob, but 
distinct from it, as the Incumbent would have had nothing farther
to do with the Chapel, or the income of it, but barely to 
nominate the Curate, who from thence forward would have been 
independent of him: However he thought the Scheme of erecting a 
new Parish to be much <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>preferable in itself, but was 
attended with more difficulties; and therefore gave up his own 
Scheme with pleasure, if the Parties concerned would join their 
Endeavours to Execute the other.</p>
<p>Upon this occasion He not only permitted, but <i>ordered</i> 
me to say to all Persons, and in all Companies, that he had 
allotted a Benefaction of &pound;400 for that Use.&nbsp; And when
some of the principal Parishioners had fixed upon the Boundaries 
of their new intended Parish, and had presented a kind of 
Petition or Memorial to him, To have those limits specified in 
the intended Act of Parliament, they used the following 
expressions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whereas it hath been made known unto 
Us,&mdash;That your Lordship hath proposed to endeavour to obtain
an Act of Parliament for Dividing the said Parish of St. Philip 
and Jacob, and for erecting and endowing a Church for the said 
Parishioners,&mdash;And that <i>you have been pleased to offer a 
large Subscription thereto</i>, We therefore with grateful Hearts
humbly take this opportunity of tendering you our hearty thanks 
for this your pious and charitable Intention, and being very 
desirous that the same may be executed, beg leave to assure your 
Lordship, that we will use our best Endeavours for promoting the 
same, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which Petition or Memorial He ordered his Secretary to copy 
out on two Pieces of Parchment.&nbsp; And then he, the Bishop, 
sent them to me to carry them to the Parishioners to be signed; 
and directed me at the same time to desire some of the 
parishioners <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>to attend him at his Palace, which 
was on a Sunday Evening; And in their and my Presence he wrote 
the following words at the Bottom of one of the Petitions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I see no objection against the Division of 
the Parish above mentioned, and hope the Gentlemen, whose Consent
is necessary, will agree to it, since the Inhabitants are the 
best judges, what is for their own Convenience: and it is a 
matter of very little Concern to any but them.&mdash;Jo. <span 
class="smcap">bristol</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise when the Fields, which lay contiguous to the intended
Church, were to be purchased, he went to see them, and then and 
there declared in my hearing, and, as far as I can recollect, in 
the hearing of several persons there present, viz. Messrs. King, 
Harrison, &amp;c., That he would purchase them for the use of the
intended Church, as soon as ever Sir Abraham Elton, the then 
Proprietor, could dispose of them.</p>
<p>Also He ordered me, at different times, to bring him a List or
Account of all the monies advanced, or engaged for: And I always 
put down his name with &pound;400 opposite to it, which he 
approved of.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the preamble of the Act of Parliament, drawn up 
by Mr. Pearson his Lordship&rsquo;s Secretary, under his 
Direction, there are these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of 
Durham (late of Bristol) for promoting so good a design is 
disposed and ready to give the sum of &pound;400 towards the 
Endowment of the new intended Vicarage, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which words in the first copy ran thus, &ldquo;And the Right 
Rev. the Lord Bishop of Bristol, &amp;c.,&rdquo; He <!-- page 
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>being
then Bishop of the See of Bristol; And I have heard his Lordship 
repeat those words in perusing the said Copy.</p>
<p>Farther; upon the Coming of the present Lord Bishop of Bristol
to this See, He ordered me to draw up a short State of the Case 
relating to the new intended Church, and the Several Expences 
necessary for completing the Design, which Paper was afterwards 
shown to the Commissioners appointed by Act of Parliament for 
building the said Church, And they Requested, That it might be 
printed.&nbsp; But before it was sent to the press, I transmitted
a Copy to the late Lord Bishop of Durham, then in London, to know
if his Lordship approved of the Publication of it, and whether He
would please to make any alteration.&nbsp; His answer was, That 
he saw no need of Alterations, and thought that the Printing and 
Dispersing of it might be of service to the charity.</p>
<p>I then directed Mr. Oliver the Printer to call upon his 
Lordship for the Manuscript, which he did; and after printing the
same, He carried fifty Copies to his Lordship for his own use; 
One of which Copies was sent to a pious and charitable lady, but 
whether by his Lordship, or his Secretary, I cannot say; The 
Issue of which was, A Benefaction of &pound;200 sent to his 
Lordship, To be disposed of either for the building or the 
Endowment as his Lordship thought fit.&nbsp; Now in the printed 
paper above mentioned, there are the following remarkable 
expressions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>&ldquo;The late Lord Bishop of 
Bristol, now of Durham, and the Right Worshipful the Mayor and 
Corporation of Bristol, <i>have contributed</i> large Sums for 
carrying the said good Purposes into Execution, 
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And upon all times and occasions, after he had Purchased the 
contiguous Grounds above mentioned of Sir Abraham Elton for the 
sum of &pound;375, He used to say, That the purchase was for the 
use of the new Intended Church, and did wish, That some little 
adjoining Tenement might be found, to be purchased with the 
remaining Sum of &pound;25 in order to make up the even money of 
&pound;400.</p>
<p>Also when I waited on his Lordship last in London, I was 
desired by Mr. Willoughby, the treasurer for the said Church, to 
ask his Lordship, How he would please to have the rents of the 
purchased Grounds disposed of, as some rents were then become 
due, viz. whether to be applied towards the endowment&mdash;or 
the Building.&nbsp; And his answer was, That the rents, being the
Interest of the money allotted for the Charity should be applied 
to the charity, as well as the Principal: But whether towards the
Endowment or Building He was not yet determined: He believed, the
Endowment: but would fix his answer, when he came down to 
Bristol.</p>
<p>And after his coming down, He several times said, that he 
would give orders concerning that affair.</p>
<p>He also sent to me one time to acquaint me, That he had a 
Benefaction put into his hands of &pound;200 (the benefaction 
above mentioned), And was pleased <!-- page 32--><a 
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>to desire my 
advice, Whether it should be applied towards the 
Endowment,&mdash;or the Building.&nbsp; My answer was, That as 
the Building was so far advanced, There was not much danger, but 
that Contributions might be raised to finish it,&mdash;Either by 
voluntary Subscriptions,&mdash;or a General collection round the 
city,&mdash;or by both methods together.&nbsp; But it would not 
be found so easy a matter to raise Contributions for the 
Endowment.&nbsp; And the Sums hitherto procured were very far 
from being a Competency for a <i>Resident</i> Minister.&nbsp; I 
then mentioned his Benefaction of &pound;400, and the &pound;400 
from Q. Ann&rsquo;s Bounty, as being a sum which might be 
depended on,&mdash;Also the benefaction of &pound;200 in his 
Lordship&rsquo;s Hands; which possibly might obtain &pound;200 
more from the Bounty;&mdash;So that the whole Sum, to be reckoned
upon, even with the supposed addition of &pound;200 from the 
Bounty, would only amount to &pound;1200, which at 3 per cent., 
would make an Income of &pound;36 a year.</p>
<p>His Lordship was pleased to approve of this Reasoning upon the
Case, and said, The &pound;200 should go towards the Endowment: 
And as his own was a bad Life, the Benefaction should be enrolled
in the name of Mr. Pearson, in order to try to obtain &pound;200 
more from Q. Ann&rsquo;s Bounty.</p>
<p>All these particulars I am willing to testify upon Oath.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
